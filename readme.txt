Hi all,

As the genotype and pedigree information is commercially sensitive, it cannot be made publicly available (contact corresponding author with reasonable request, as detailed in the paper).

There are two folders in this github. 

"full_code" contains the full code for the analysis but none of the files. If input files are available, simply place them all inside the "input" directory and then run all of the code as directed by full_code/readme.txt.

"outputs" contains a subset of code and input files that will allow you to generate all the figures and tables for this paper. outputs/create_outputs.txt can be run as-is and should produce all of the outputs. See outputs/readme.txt for more information.

Many thanks,
Evelyn
